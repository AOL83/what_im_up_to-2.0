# what_im_up_to
Just my dumping ground for ideas.

# Livestreaming stuff

1) Make cnlohr_social_media_tools able to get stream metadata like viewer count.
2) Add examples to that to handle multi-spawnof data.  Thaeli points out ```dostuff.sh | tee >(command1) >(command2) | logfile.txt``` cado the trick.
3) Add plugin for xed to allow for commenters on youtube to notate lines in xed.
4) Make plugin for xed to broadcast full view of all tabs to a web page.

# Libsurvive

1) Keep praying that AlbinoFrenchie stays on top of things with the libsurvive homebase.
2)   -> Reliant on Unit-E Rasphat <- Make my orange-pi-vive-pack.
3) Write 3D engine that can also broadcast to browser.  Use rawdraw as the windower, but that's it.
4) ESP32 Tracker
5)   -> Reliant on tccengine <- Livestream game production of my line-based SPT ripoff.
6) FDM Multitrackers


ESP8266/ESP32 stuff
1) Make a system for doing wireless audio microphones with diversity in reception.
